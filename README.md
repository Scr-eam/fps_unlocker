# fps_unlocker made to support all versions of roblox by modifying flags.

# this wasn't an original idea of mine, the flags were from another project.

## when using the manual installation u must choose your roblox version folder
## the path will look something like this C:\Users\Scream\AppData\Local\Roblox\Versions\version-4981859nfajn81ba
